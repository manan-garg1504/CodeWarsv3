# CodeWarsv3

Repository to record my own learnings/code for CodeWars v3.

Until now, I have learned the following/at least know of the following resources:

-> Monogame: A game library built for C#, this is an open-source implementation of Microsoft's XNA framework. Over the past weeks, I have learned to install it(without going through installing Visual Studio), learned the basic logic flow in a monogame project (even a game in general),read through some cool projects implemented with it, tried some basic stuff myself, and even come across resources to increase my knowlegde on C#.

-> Unity: An important starting point for a lot of game developers. I am currently learning how it can help us refine and use any 3D models we create.
